- Consider rate limiting for external APIs
- Document all API endpoints
- Add input validation
- Implement proper error responses

## Issues Encountered
1. TypeScript Configuration:
   - Error: "No inputs were found in config file"
   - Cause: No source files in src directory yet
   - Resolution: Fixed when initial source files were created

2. Environment Files:
   - Issue: Unable to create .env file directly through tool calls
   - Resolution: Created file manually with necessary configuration
   - Status: Resolved

3. Jest Configuration:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions
   - Resolution: Installed @types/jest
   - Status: Resolved

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create initial source files
2. ✅ Create .env file with necessary configuration
3. ✅ Set up test data for market analysis
4. ✅ Create API endpoints
5. ✅ Implement error handling
6. ✅ Add input validation
7. Next Phase (Phase 1):
   - Implement core backend functionality
   - Create market analysis service
   - Implement property search
   - Develop frontend components
   - Set up API client
   - Implement property analysis features
