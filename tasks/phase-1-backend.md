# Phase 1: Backend Core Functionality

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the backend core functionality of the rental property investment analyzer. The focus is on creating a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend that can handle property analysis, market data, and investment calculations.

## Dependencies
- Node.js/Express backend (from Phase 0)
- PostgreSQL database (from Phase 0)
- RapidAPI account for property listings
- HUD Fair Market Rents data
- FHFA House Price Index data

## Implementation Status

### 1. Core Services [COMPLETED]

#### 1.1 Market Analysis Service [COMPLETED]
- Implemented `StandardMarketAnalyzer` class that:
  - Analyzes locations using test data for rental rates and property values
  - Calculates key market metrics:
    - Average rental rates and property values
    - Cap rates and cash-on-cash returns
    - Price-to-rent ratios
    - Rental yield
    - Market trends using linear regression
  - Uses string-based location IDs (e.g., "san-francisco-ca")
  - Includes comprehensive error handling
  - Ready for integration with real market data API

#### 1.2 Property Listing Service [COMPLETED]
- Implemented `PropertyListingService` class that:
  - Integrates with RapidAPI for property listings
  - Provides methods for:
    - Searching properties by location, price range, and features
    - Getting property details by ID
  - Uses string-based IDs for properties and locations
  - Includes data transformation and error handling
  - Ready for production use with API key configuration

#### 1.3 Cash Flow Calculator [COMPLETED]
- Implemented `StandardCashFlowCalculator` class that:
  - Calculates monthly and annual cash flow
  - Computes cash-on-cash return
  - Handles various expense types
  - Includes comprehensive input validation

### 1.4 API Endpoints [COMPLETED]

#### Analysis API
- POST `/api/analysis`
  - Input: Property ID and analysis parameters
  - Output: Comprehensive analysis including:
    - Property details
    - Market metrics
    - Cash flow projections
  - Includes input validation and error handling

#### Health Check API
- GET `/api/health`
  - Returns server status and version
  - No database dependency

### 1.5 Testing [COMPLETED]

#### Unit Tests
- Market Analyzer tests:
  - Location analysis
  - Metric calculations
  - Error handling
- Cash Flow Calculator tests:
  - Monthly and annual calculations
  - Edge cases
  - Input validation

#### Integration Tests
- API endpoint tests:
  - Analysis endpoint
  - Input validation
  - Error responses
- Property listing service tests:
  - Property search
  - Property details
  - Error handling

### 1.6 Documentation [COMPLETED]

#### API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Error codes and handling

#### Code Documentation
- Type definitions
- Interface documentation
- Service implementation details
- Error handling patterns

## Definition of Done
- [x] All core services implemented and tested
- [x] API endpoints documented and tested
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Input validation in place
- [x] Test coverage for critical paths
- [x] Documentation complete

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Monitor performance and error rates
3. Gather user feedback
4. Plan Phase 2 features:
   - User authentication
   - Saved analyses
   - Historical data tracking
   - Advanced market metrics

## Notes
- Market analysis service is implemented with test data and ready for integration with real database
- Unit tests cover core functionality of both services
- Integration tests verify API endpoint behavior
- API documentation is available in OpenAPI format
- Input validation ensures data integrity
- Error handling provides consistent error responses
- Consider adding more test cases for edge scenarios
- Focus on MVP features first
- Use in-memory caching instead of Redis for now
- Implement basic error handling
- Add logging for debugging
- Consider rate limiting for external APIs
- Document all API endpoints
- Add input validation
- Implement proper error responses
- Market analysis service is implemented with test data
- Ready to integrate with real database
- Need to add unit tests for market analyzer
- Need to create API endpoints for market analysis
