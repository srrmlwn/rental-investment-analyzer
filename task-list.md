# Rental Property Investment Analyzer - Implementation Tasks

## Phase 0: Project Setup and Infrastructure

### 0.1 Initial Project Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
COMMENT - I have already created a github repository - https://github.com/srrmlwn/rental-investment-analyzer/tree/main
RESPONSE: Great! We can skip this task and move on to the next steps.

- [ ] Set up project structure
  ```
  rental-investment-analyzer/
  ├── backend/           # Node.js/Express API
  ├── frontend/          # React/Next.js app
  ├── data/             # Static data files
  └── scripts/          # Utility scripts
  ```
- [ ] Configure development environment
  - [ ] Set up Docker for local development
COMMENT - why docker? What are the benefits and drawbacks?
RESPONSE: Docker provides several benefits:
- Consistent development environment across team members
- Easy setup of dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Simplified deployment process
- Isolation of services
Drawbacks:
- Additional complexity for solo development
- Learning curve if not familiar with Docker
- Slightly higher resource usage
Alternative: We could skip Docker for MVP and use direct local installations if you prefer.

  - [ ] Configure VS Code settings
COMMENT - do we really need this? I am already using cursor. Maybe you need to document code styles as a cursor rule?
RESPONSE: You're right. Since you're using Cursor, we can skip VS Code settings. Instead, we should:
- Document code style rules in a .cursorrc or similar file
- Set up ESLint/Prettier configurations that work with Cursor
- Create a coding standards document

  - [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Create initial README.md with setup instructions

### 0.2 Development Environment
- [ ] Set up backend development environment
  - [ ] Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript
  - [ ] Configure Express with basic middleware
  - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL locally
  - [ ] Set up Redis locally
COMMENT - why do we need Redis? What benefits does it give for our MVP implementation?
RESPONSE: Redis provides several benefits for our MVP:
- Caching property listings to reduce API calls (RapidAPI has rate limits)
- Storing analysis results for quick retrieval
- Session management if we add user features
- Job queue for PDF generation
However, for a minimal MVP, we could:
- Use in-memory caching instead
- Store analysis results in PostgreSQL
- Skip PDF generation initially
- Add Redis later when needed

- [ ] Set up frontend development environment
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js project
COMMENT - why Next.js vs Reactjs? What is more appropriate for our project?
RESPONSE: Next.js advantages for our project:
- Built-in API routes (can host our backend API)
- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Automatic code splitting
- Built-in routing
- Better performance out of the box
However, for a minimal MVP, we could use plain React if:
- We don't need SEO
- We're hosting API separately
- We want simpler setup
- We don't need SSR

  - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Set up basic component structure

### 0.3 Deployment Setup
- [ ] Set up Heroku deployment (MVP choice for simplicity)
  - [ ] Create Heroku app
  - [ ] Configure Heroku PostgreSQL add-on
  - [ ] Configure Heroku Redis add-on
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure environment variables
  - [ ] Set up .env files for different environments
  - [ ] Configure Heroku config vars
  - [ ] Set up RapidAPI key management

## Phase 1: Backend Core (MVP)

### 1.1 Database Setup
- [ ] Create database migrations
  - [ ] Implement locations table
  - [ ] Implement properties table
  - [ ] Implement market_data table
  - [ ] Implement analysis_results table
- [ ] Set up database seeding
  - [ ] Create seed data for testing
  - [ ] Implement seed scripts
COMMENT - what is seeding? what is this seeding for?
RESPONSE: Database seeding is the process of populating a database with initial test data. For our project, it's useful for:
- Testing the application with realistic data
- Development environment setup
- Demo purposes
- Testing edge cases
Example seed data could include:
- Sample cities and zip codes
- Test property listings
- Market data for specific locations
- Sample analysis results

### 1.2 Property Listing API Integration
- [ ] Implement RapidAPI integration
  - [ ] Create API client for realty-in-us.p.rapidapi.com
  - [ ] Implement property search endpoint
  - [ ] Add rate limiting and caching
  - [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Create property data models
  - [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces
  - [ ] Implement data normalization
  - [ ] Add validation

### 1.3 Core API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement location endpoints
  - [ ] GET /api/v1/locations/search
  - [ ] GET /api/v1/locations/:id/properties
COMMENT - what is an example use case of locations/search vs. properties/search? Assume that I will be providing valid locations (either a city or a set of zip codes) for the MVP.
RESPONSE: You're right. For MVP, we can simplify this. Here's the revised approach:
- Remove locations/search endpoint
- Focus on properties/search with location parameters
- Example API: GET /api/v1/properties/search?city=Austin or GET /api/v1/properties/search?zipCodes=78701,78702
- This simplifies our API and matches the MVP requirements better

- [ ] Implement property endpoints
  - [ ] GET /api/v1/properties/search
  - [ ] GET /api/v1/properties/:id/analysis
COMMENT - should we just start with the analysis API in the MVP?
RESPONSE: Yes, for MVP we should focus on:
- Single endpoint: POST /api/v1/analysis/calculate
- Input: location (city/zipCodes) and optional filters
- Output: Analysis results including properties and cash flow
- This simplifies our API and provides immediate value

### 1.4 Static Data Management
- [ ] Create data structure for static files
  - [ ] Define JSON schemas
  - [ ] Create sample data files
- [ ] Implement data import system
  - [ ] Create import scripts
  - [ ] Add validation
  - [ ] Set up scheduled updates
- [ ] Implement market data endpoints
  - [ ] GET /api/v1/market-data/rental-rates
COMMENT - where do you suggest we can get the rental rates from? Suggest open source data sets.
RESPONSE: For rental rates, we can use:
- Zillow Research Data: https://www.zillow.com/research/
- HUD Fair Market Rents: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html
- Census Bureau American Community Survey: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/
- Local MLS data (if available)
For MVP, we can start with HUD data as it's:
- Free and publicly available
- Updated annually
- Covers all US locations
- Includes different property types

  - [ ] GET /api/v1/market-data/market-averages
COMMENT - where do you suggest we can get the rental rates from? Suggest open source data sets.
RESPONSE: For market averages, we can use:
- Zillow Home Value Index: https://www.zillow.com/research/
- Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index: https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads
- Census Bureau Housing Data: https://www.census.gov/topics/housing.html
For MVP, we can use:
- FHFA data for property values
- Census data for demographic information
- Zillow data for market trends (if available)

### 1.5 Basic Analysis Engine
- [ ] Implement cash flow calculator
  - [ ] Create calculation models
COMMENT - suggest example calculation models with an example
RESPONSE: Here's an example cash flow calculation model:
```typescript
interface CashFlowInput {
  propertyPrice: number;
  downPayment: number;
  interestRate: number;
  loanTerm: number;
  monthlyRent: number;
  operatingExpenses: {
    propertyTax: number;
    insurance: number;
    maintenance: number;
    management: number;
    hoa: number;
    utilities: number;
    vacancy: number;
  };
}

interface CashFlowResult {
  monthly: {
    income: number;
    expenses: {
      mortgage: number;
      operating: number;
      total: number;
    };
    netCashFlow: number;
  };
  annual: {
    income: number;
    expenses: number;
    netCashFlow: number;
    cashOnCashReturn: number;
  };
}

// Example calculation:
const input: CashFlowInput = {
  propertyPrice: 300000,
  downPayment: 60000, // 20%
  interestRate: 0.06, // 6%
  loanTerm: 30,
  monthlyRent: 2000,
  operatingExpenses: {
    propertyTax: 300, // 1.2% annually
    insurance: 100,
    maintenance: 150,
    management: 200, // 10% of rent
    hoa: 50,
    utilities: 0, // tenant pays
    vacancy: 100, // 5% of rent
  }
};

// Results would show:
// - Monthly mortgage payment
// - Monthly operating expenses
// - Net monthly cash flow
// - Annual cash flow
// - Cash on cash return
```
