I want to build a rental property investment analyzer application.

I envision this to be an app that can be accessed as a web application, or a periodic report generator which sends an email with results of the analysis.

The objective of the analyzer is to analyze rental properties in a given location, e.g., a list of zip codes, or a city.

In the first version of the app, I would like the analyzer compute predicted cash flow based on the properties list price, expected rent, and other parameters such as mortgage rate, monthly operating expenses etc.

In the future versions of the app, I would also like to analyze cap rate, and cash on cash return.

Do not write any code for this application at the moment.

I would like you to brainstorm requirements with me, on how to develop this app.

Write all the product features that we want to build to a brd.md file.

Once we brainstorm business requirements, we can start discussing technical specifications.
